# Installing Google Chrome on Kali Linux

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Google Chrome does not provide a direct package for Kali Linux. However, you can still install it on Kali Linux using the Debian package since Kali is based on Debian.

## Steps:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Download the Google Chrome Debian package using `wget` or `curl`. For example:

   ```bash
   wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   ```

3. Install the package using `dpkg`:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   ```

4. If there are any missing dependencies, you can use the following command to fix them:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -f
   ```

5. After installation, you can launch Google Chrome from the application menu or by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   google-chrome-stable
   ```

## Important Notes:

- Keep in mind that the steps and links provided here might change over time, so it's recommended to check the official [Google Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for the latest download link and instructions.

- Using a browser on a security-focused distribution like Kali Linux may have implications for the security of your system. It's recommended to use Kali Linux for its intended purpose and consider using a different distribution for regular desktop tasks if needed.
